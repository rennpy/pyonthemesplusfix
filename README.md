# Simple workaround for using themes+ on pyoncord, any theme!

Install from ```https://vendetta.nexpid.xyz/themes-plus/```

- (Tested version 224.15, most probably works on others, feel free to tell me if it doesnt)

## Read full instructions before an attempt, step by step will prove to be tricky
   > [!IMPORTANT]
> First, make sure to toggle on the theme with themes+ support. then, go into themes+ settings and double tap "themes+ is inactive" for dev mode
>
**Enter this link ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acquitelol/rosiecord/master/Packs/Plumpy/``` into "custom icon packs" tab in the Base URL input box, with ```x2``` in the File Suffix input box, then reload. Refer to the**

After that, go back to the dev settings of themes+ and look at the force icons tab. you should be able to select between 3 types of icon packs now as seen 
 [here](https://github.com/rennpy/pyonthemesplusfix/assets/158360149/6622e96d-b25b-43d5-bcce-77afc68798c3). 
 
 **Choose your icon pack, press reload, then go back (you should see** [this error message](https://github.com/rennpy/pyonthemesplusfix/assets/158360149/8bb42f45-568c-4b56-9c96-54840a924d51))

Now, do this RIGHT AFTER the error shows up.
- Press back to go to your main screen (in a server, or dm doesnt matter but I tried this in a dm) then wait a few seconds and tab out of discord, then CLOSE THE TAB BY SWIPING IT UP

 - Reopen discord and themes+ should finally work! you will get your custom iconpack and can freely switch to another theme even without themes+ support, it will keep the iconpack enabled 

enjoy :D
